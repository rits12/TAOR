# The Adventures of Rutvak

I consider video games to be the ultimate form of art: they combine writing, music, drawing and math to create impactful experiences. Wondering what my life might look like with the vision of an 80’s Japanese studio, I set out to work on The Adventures of Rutvak. As a result, I can express my story with symbolism, allowing me to reflect on my life’s “plot” and “boss fights.”

In TAOR, Rutvak (my alter ego) hunts monsters for a living, selling their parts to characters like Brofessor Leach, who uses the DNA to create power ups like protein powder and preworkout.

This project has involved lots of coding and technical tools — also, due to my red-green color blindness, drawing is rather difficult. With pertinaciousness, I overcame these barriers. Not to mention, my old hairstyle was hard to animate, so I got a buzzcut.

It might seem outlandish, but I plan to produce this game in a way such that only those who truly know me would understand its significance. All of the characters’ designs illustrate my friends, and the action indirectly depicts the major events in my life thus far. As I experience new things and meet people, The Adventures will continue to expand, one day serving as a secret autobiography. 

For my The Adventures of Rutvak demo, I used Phaser, an open source framework for rendering games in a browser. I looked to the ULSW DeviantArt community for inspiration in sprite design style. TexturePacker was used to put sprites in JSON arrays, later accessed by my JS game code and compiled through a Python HTTP server.
